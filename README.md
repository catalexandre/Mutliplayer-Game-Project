The origin of this game goes back to me stumbling on an interesting video by The Coding Train on YouTube about the tiling wave function collapse algorithm(TWFC), originally created by mxgmn on github, as I thought it would be a good challenge to completely rewrite the overlapping version of the algorithm(OFWC) in GameMakerStudio2. 

Here is a link to the Coding Train video: https://youtu.be/rI_y2GAlQFM?si=2pp_GDA5mVyBgGXT

Here is a link to Maxim Gumin's github page Wave Function Collapse: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

Both of these works are properties of The Coding Train and Maxim Gumin respectively.

The idea then came to me that I could combine this algorithm with others to make for interesting map generation, and this is where the idea for this game came from. At that point I had a vague idea of what I wanted the game to be and I knew I wanted it to be a mix between the survival and roguelike genres where you play against your friends. I did however know that I wanted to implement different algorithms and programming concepts that I find interesting because I knew that it would make it interesting for me working alone on this project and I wanted to display my programming skills.

The first thing I did was write the entire server as a client-server architecture, but quickly realized that if I wanted ease of use for anyone playing my game, a peer-to-peer architecture was more suitable considering the type of game I would be making. The benefits of a peer-to-peer architecture which I wanted for my game was ease of use, and not needing to host a server myself, as whoever was playing could decide to be the host of a game with their friends.

The next step was to write the OWFC algorithm, as it was of course what started this project after all...
